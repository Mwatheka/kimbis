          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Enchanting crystal-clear waters protected by a coral reef, with white sandy beaches that stretch hundreds of kilometers: This is <b>Watamu Island</b> an old fishing village on the Indian Ocean, in southeast Kenya. Watamu is located around 100km (62 miles) up the coast from Kenya’s second city, <b>Mombasa and Watamu</b> has long been known for its rich Swahili culture and its history. Now it’s also known as one of Kenya most impressive beach vacation spots, and an incredible water sports haven that attracts celebrity milliners, billionaires’ actors, and wealthy of the wealthiest. The trade winds that blow in the afternoons make it ideal for <b>windsurfing and kitesurfing</b>, while <b>paddleboarders</b> have the chance to get close to the many species of <b>dolphin and shacks</b> that swim in the ocean. Watamu Beach’s crystal-clear waters make it an excellent location for <b>snorkeling</b> and <b>diving</b>, and the surrounding area is home to an abundance of wildlife. The shoreline in the area features white sand beaches and offshore coral formations arranged in different bays and beaches: Garoda Beach, Turtle Bay, Blue Lagoon Bay, Watamu Bay, Ocean breeze, and Kanani reef and Jacaranda beach. They are protected as part of the <b>Watamu Marine National Park</b>. The Marine Park is considered one of the best snorkeling and diving areas on the coast of East Africa. It is also rated the third-best beach in Africa, for its crystal-clear water and silver sand beaches. In order to assist the managing authorities namely Kenyan Wildlife Service, in protecting the Park, local community groups, the tourist sector and environmental groups have formed a unique organization <b>Watamu Marine Association</b>. Members of this group are Turtle Bay, Hemingways, Ocean Sports, Arocha Kenya, Lonno Lodge, Mida Community Conservation group, Watamu Boat Operator, Safari Sellers and women's group. The ruins of Gedi (also known as Gede) are located near Watamu. <b>The Watamu Marine National Park</b> is located around 1km off the coast of Watamu Beach, and it contains <b>600 fish species</b>, 110 species of stony coral, and countless invertebrates, crustaceans and molluscs.

Watamu is a cosmopolitan town which blends Kenyan, Arab, and Italian influences. Watamu Beach is a popular post beach holiday getaway for travelers who want to unwind. If you have a strict itinerary and want to see everything that Kenya has to offer, then we recommend that you spend a few days in Watamu. However, travelers who want a beach holiday can enjoy a week of Watamu’s cool ocean breeze and gentle waves. Similarly, snorkelling and diving enthusiasts can make Watamu the focal point of there beach holiday, Watamu Beach is easily accessible from Malindi and Mombasa, and you can fly to both destinations from Nairobi.

It takes around 4 hours to drive from Diani to Watamu, but you can reduce the journey time to 1.5 hours by taking a 15-minute flight from Ukunda to Vipingo and then finishing your journey with a 1 hour 20-minute taxi journey from <b>Vipingo from Watamu</b>. Watamu is on the North Coast of Kenya, a stretch of coastline which spans from Nyali to Malindi. The road journey from Mombasa is slightly longer and the drive will take around two hours. The taxi journey will cost up to Usd 100 although it is possible to drive from Nairobi, the long road journey takes around 8 hours, so we recommend that you fly to Malindi or Mombasa to shorten the journey time.
